## Reading List

#### Required readings:
- [Common vulnerabilities guide for C programmers](https://security.web.cern.ch/security/recommendations/en/codetools/c.shtml). Take note of the unsafe C library functions listed here, and how they are the source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This list will be relevant for the project and this week's quiz.
- (Reference) [Memory layout. Explains a C program's memory layout](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/), replicating the discussion in the second lecture.

#### Supplemental readings:
- [How buffer overflows work](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/08/how-security-flaws-work-the-buffer-overflow/). This article does a great job of walking you through how stack smashing works, and also talks about some defenses against it, which are covered in more depth in next week's materials.
- (Reference/refresher) [PC Assembly Language](http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/), by Paul Carter. This free book introduces x86 assembly, and should complement ideas seen in the lectures.
- [Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit](http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html) - original article on the topic by Aleph One, in 1996
- [Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities](http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf) - report describing these format string attacks when they were first recognized
- [Basic Integer Overflows](http://phrack.org/issues/60/10.html) - discussion of how overflowing integers can be a vector of attack
